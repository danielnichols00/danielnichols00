## Hi, I'm Daniel

I am a recent graduate from Queensland University of Technology and am eager to start my career in software development.

- I’m currently working on building an educational Minecraft mod! I'm using it to develop strong long-term development habits, version control, documentation, feature planning—as well as to strengthen my object-oriented programming skills.
- I’m currently learning Java and C#, and continuing to grow my skills in web development technologies, frameworks, and backend logic.
- I’m looking for help with using GitHub collaboratively, understanding more advanced Git workflows, and expanding my knowledge of how to structure larger projects effectively.
